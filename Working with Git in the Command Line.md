# Working with Git in the Command Line

## Introduction

Git is a very popular distributed version control system. In this lab, you will be asked to perform basic Git-related tasks in the command line, which includes installing Git, initializing a repository, adding and committing files, and creating and merging branches.

## Solution

Log in to the lab server using the credentials provided:

```
ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
```

### Install and Configure Git

1. Install Git:
   ```
   sudo yum install git -y
   ```

1. Clear your screen:
   ```
   clear
   ```

1. Update the Git user email setting to be `cloud_user@mybusiness.com`:
   ```
   git config --global user.email "cloud_user@mybusiness.com"
   ```

1. Update the Git username setting to be `cloud_user`:
   ```
   git config --global user.name "cloud_user"
   ```

### Initialize the Git Repository

1. Clear your screen:
   ```
   clear
   ```

1. Write the full pathname of the current working directory:
   ```
   pwd
   ```

1. Create the `alpha` directory in the home directory:
   ```
   mkdir alpha
   ```

1. List the names of the files in the current directory:
   ```
   ll
   ```

1. Change directories to `/home/cloud_user/alpha`:
   ```
   cd alpha/
   ```

1. Initialize the repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```

1. `clear` your screen.

### Add and Commit Files to the Git Repository

1. Create two files called `artifact01` and `artifact02`:
   ```
   touch artifact01 artifact02
   ```

1. Add the newly created files to the staging area:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

1. Check the status:
   ```
   git status
   ```

1. `clear` your screen.

1. Commit the files to the repository and include a message:
   ```
   git commit -m "added two files"
   ```

1. Check the status:
   ```
   git status
   ```

1. `clear` your screen.

### Create Branches of the Git Repository

1. Create a new branch called `hot_fixes`:
   ```
   git branch hot_fixes
   ```

1. Check the branch:
   ```
   git branch
   ```

1. `clear` your screen.

1. Create and checkout a branch called `feature01`:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature01
   ```

1. Check the branch:
   ```
   git branch
   ```

1. Create a directory called `feature01`:
   ```
   mkdir feature01
   ```

1. Create a file called `manifest.txt` in the `feature01` directory:
   ```
   touch feature01/manifest.txt
   ```

1. Add the changes to the `feature01` branch:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

1. Check the status:
   ```
   git status
   ```

1. Commit changes to the `feature01` branch with a message:
   ```
   git commit -m "adding feature01 directory with manifest"
   ```

1. Check the status:
   ```
   git status
   ```

1. `clear` your screen.

### Merge a Branch with the Master

1. Check the branch:
   ```
   git branch
   ```

1. Checkout the `master` branch:
   ```
   git checkout master
   ```

1. Confirm you're in the `master` branch:
   ```
   git branch
   ```

1. Merge the `feature01` branch with `master`:
   ```
   git merge feature01
   ```
